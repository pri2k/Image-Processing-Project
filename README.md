 ## AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION (ALPR) SYSTEM 

 Overview
This project is an Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction. 
The system processes images of vehicles, detects license plates, and extracts the alphanumeric characters for further use.

 Features
- Real-time license plate detection using YOLO.
- Text extraction from license plates using OCR.
- Supports various image formats for detection and recognition.
- Efficient and accurate recognition for different lighting conditions and angles.
- Python-based implementation with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.

 Technologies Used
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) - For detecting license plates in images.
- OCR (Tesseract or EasyOCR) - For extracting text from detected plates.
- OpenCV - For image preprocessing and manipulation.
- TensorFlow/PyTorch - For deep learning-based detection.


## Future Enhancements
- Improve OCR accuracy with fine-tuned models.
- Integrate with a cloud database for real-time logging.
- Develop a web-based UI for easy access and monitoring.
