 ## AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION (ALPR) SYSTEM 

 Overview
This project is an Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) System that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text extraction. 
The system processes images of vehicles, detects license plates, and extracts the alphanumeric characters for further use.

 Features
- Real-time license plate detection using YOLO.
- Text extraction from license plates using OCR.
- Supports various image formats for detection and recognition.
- Efficient and accurate recognition for different lighting conditions and angles.
- Python-based implementation with OpenCV and deep learning frameworks.

 Technologies Used
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) - For detecting license plates in images.
- OCR (Tesseract or EasyOCR) - For extracting text from detected plates.
- OpenCV - For image preprocessing and manipulation.
- TensorFlow/PyTorch - For deep learning-based detection.


## Future Enhancements
- Improve OCR accuracy with fine-tuned models.
- Integrate with a cloud database for real-time logging.
- Develop a web-based UI for easy access and monitoring.


## Here is the complete workflow of our ALPR system:

*Uploading the Image* – We start by taking an image of a vehicle containing the license plate.
*Grayscale Conversion* – The image is converted to grayscale to reduce complexity, as color is not necessary for detecting edges or characters.
*Pre-processing* – This includes noise removal using filters like Gaussian blur to smooth the image, making it easier to detect edges.
*Edge Detection* – We apply edge detection (like Canny Edge Detection) to highlight boundaries and shapes in the image, especially around the plate.
*Finding Contours* – This step detects possible plate-like regions by finding rectangles or quadrilaterals in the image.
*License Plate Extraction* – From the detected contours, we identify the one most likely to be the license plate and crop that region.
*Character Segmentation* – We separate individual characters from the plate for recognition.
*Character Recognition* – Finally, we use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the characters into readable text.

This entire pipeline forms the backbone of our license plate recognition system.
